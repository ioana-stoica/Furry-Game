# Furry Game
This game was created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript ES6.

## About the game 

The hero of this game is **Furry** who moves on a board with the size of 10x10 fields.

There is a coin in a random field of the board. The player controlling Furry with arrow keys on the keyboard must move Furry to the coin. When he does that, the coin disappears from the board and appears in a different field (also random), and the player gets 1 point.

If the player hits a wall, the game ends: the board disappears and a "Game over" message is displayed.

Also, at any time during the game, the player can see how many coins he has collected.
